In high school, I hadn't been diagnosed yet with my anxiety and depression, and even though it was present it didn't feel nearly as bad as this. I hit my 20's, now 23 yrs old, and I am having constant depression cycles. The cycles are becoming more frequent and each time it feels harder to come out of. As of lately I have been probably the most down that I have felt to date. I am in my sophomore year of college as a bio major. I haven't been keeping up with classes, I have been failing exams and I don't have nearly enough credits to keep my scholarship for my junior year. I have fucked myself so badly with school I don't know what to do. I want so badly to take a leave of absence to get myself together, up my medication and see a therapist. I really want to get better. However, if I take a leave from school I will lose all financial aid for my junior year as well. My fiancé and I are pretty financially responsible people and have budgeted out for the next year and a half based on the financial aid we both receive. It is not an option to lose that money or we will be completely fucked. I am asking advice on what to do. I need to take a break from school or I will just keep digging myself deeper into this GPA and depression nightmare, but we also can't lose any money from it. I do want to reenroll for the fall semester, but I just need a break now. I am lost. Any advice would be so helpful.\", 'label': 'Trouble falling or staying asleep or sleeping too much', 'reason': 'The given post does not mention any difficulties with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.'}\n",

I feel like it\\'s a catch 22... if I keep her number it\\'ll just be a reminder that she only wants to talk when it\\'s convenient for her, but if I delete her and show that I\\'m upset it\\'ll piss off the rest of my family.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what to do any more. How do I handle someone who is making absolutely no attempt to meet me halfway? It\\'s like she doesn\\'t care about me or my family any more.', 'label': 'Trouble falling or staying asleep or sleeping too much', 'reason': \"The given post does not mention any specific sleep-related issues.

I was going to lunch with two people who I consider to be friends, when they agreed they have no idea what I do outside of work and could only say a couple superficial things about me. We go out for drinks, food, etc on a regular basis. . . I live as an expat so your coworkers are everything- they act as your family and friends all in one.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI've been depressed pretty much right after I came here and haven't felt like myself. I used to be the funny, witty person that was complimented for my confidence. Here, I am quiet, awkward, and passive. It has become a spiral where I try to speak up to be more involved, but then no one responds, so I become more insecure and talk less.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI still have half a year left before my contract ends and I can leave, so any helpful advice about how I can improve my situation would be appreciated.\", 'label': 'Trouble concentrating on things such as reading the newspaper or watching television', 'reason': 'The given post text does not indicate any problem related to trouble concentrating on things such as reading the newspaper or watching television.'}\n",

The post is long, bear with me. This might be my last post, and I \\~\\~want to\\~\\~ have to get some things out of my chest. I am very tired, and haven't been really feeling anything since yesterday, after I got back from Chicago, so it might be a bit messy, and just... not organized at all. But here goes:\\n\\nI'm so lonely. I want people to like me. But all I am is a waste. A waste of time, resources, and opportunities.\\n\\nBy no means am I the unluckiest person around. I have an above average IQ (152 WISC, 149 WAIS), I have certain traits that I'd like to be proud of, such as being orderly and responsible, speaking 3 languages fluently (EN, ES, KR) and 2 languages in the beginner level (FR and ZH) and know a couple of more alphabets like Cyrillic, Greek and Yiddish, and I absolutely love to learn, read, and to experience. but somehow, even with all that, I managed to be the biggest fucking trainwreck I could possibly imagine.\\n\\nMy father locked me in dark rooms for hours when I was 3 to 5. I was diagnosed w/ T1D when I was 5. I was always a bit weak, underweight. I started having behavioral problems since 10,  including but not limited to: violent tendencies, compulsive lying, stealing (I don't know if it's kleptomania, I hope it's not. But even if it is, won't make another difference. Just another problem on my list), etc. I was diagnosed with Night Terrors and Bipolar Depression when I was 12, 13 maybe. I have suffered from achluophobia and a mild claustrophobia, as well as some social issues. I won't label my social issues, as I haven't got a clinical diagnosis like anyhting else on this list, but I think it fits more into the anti-social category than asocial or social anxiety, because of my negative and possibly misanthropist views. I have 2 past suicide attempts, once by asphyxiation, and the other by insulin overdose. Now, I'm just wasting away, induging myself and slowly poisoning myself.\\n\\nMy only friends (3 or 4), whom I've always valued highly, are distancing away from me slowly, after nearly 6 years of friendship (to be honest, I don't blame them, because I'm fucking weird to hang around. But it does hurt quite a bit). I have a cousin 3 months younger than me, who has a much better and more successful life than me. His father (my mom's younger brother by 1 year) is the current president (33rd) of the Korean-American Association of Chicago and a Northfield Township trustee. My cousin has a better social life, better health (he is \\\"ripped\\\" as one would describe, and taller than me, while I am barely keeping my muscle mass together. I'm 56kg, 170cm), has better looks than me, is a better student (no problems in school) and is just all-around a better person than me. People follow him around, and as much as it hurts my pride to admit this, I am envious that girls just follow him around.\\n\\nMy family isn't very supportive neither. My aunt and uncle cares for me (I hope) but treats me as if I were some lazy-ass scum, because their son is objectively better than me, even though I am doing my fucking best, trying not to die from a DKA every day. I lost 5-6 pounds in 2 weeks, all muscle mass, because I don't have much body fat. I excercise semi-regularly (45 mins a day, 3-4 hours a wekk, maybe), I study, I do what everyone else does, and I even put more time into it (all possible because I assist school once a month now, all assignemnts are submitted through a school intranet). My grandparents (the ones alive) clearly cares more for my cousins than me, and they don't necessarily hide that. My dad compares me to his former self, and acts like I don't put enough (or any) effort and treats me like a literal pet. People actively avoid me, because my personality is just straight up fucked, and I act so weird, almost pathetic around others, that I'd rather stay at home than humiliate myself in front of others.\\n\\nMy biggest problem and fear is that I'll slowly become my father, because he is the most despicable human being I can think of. He is just such a hypocrite, miserable, self-justifying, rationalizing, condescending piece of shit; but I am so similar to him, whether it be personality, tastes, interests, points of view, etc. Another big fear of mine is that no one will validate my efforts, despite it being my best. But it's already becoming true.\\n\\nI'm just tired of nobody loving me. I had this one girl that I liked since 5 years ago.

I have an above average IQ (152 WISC, 149 WAIS), I have certain traits that I'd like to be proud of, such as being orderly and responsible, speaking 3 languages fluently (EN, ES, KR) and 2 languages in the beginner level (FR and ZH) and know a couple of more alphabets like Cyrillic, Greek and Yiddish, and I absolutely love to learn, read, and to experience. but somehow, even with all that, I managed to be the biggest fucking trainwreck I could possibly imagine. \\n\\nMy father locked me in dark rooms for hours when I was 3 to 5. I was diagnosed w/ T1D when I was 5. I was always a bit weak, underweight. I started having behavioral problems since 10,  including but not limited to: violent tendencies, compulsive lying, stealing (I don't know if it's kleptomania, I hope it's not. But even if it is, won't make another difference. Just another problem on my list), etc. I was diagnosed with Night Terrors and Bipolar Depression when I was 12, 13 maybe. I have suffered from achluophobia and a mild claustrophobia, as well as some social issues. I won't label my social issues, as I haven't got a clinical diagnosis like anyhting else on this list, but I think it fits more into the anti-social category than asocial or social anxiety, because of my negative and possibly misanthropist views. I have 2 past suicide attempts, once by asphyxiation, and the other by insulin overdose. Now, I'm just wasting away, induging myself and slowly poisoning myself.\\n\\nMy only friends (3 or 4), whom I've always valued highly, are distancing away from me slowly, after nearly 6 years of friendship (to be honest, I don't blame them, because I'm fucking weird to hang around. But it does hurt quite a bit). I have a cousin 3 months younger than me, who has a much better and more successful life than me. His father (my mom's younger brother by 1 year) is the current president (33rd) of the Korean-American Association of Chicago and a Northfield Township trustee. My cousin has a better social life, better health (he is \\\"ripped\\\" as one would describe, and taller than me, while I am barely keeping my muscle mass together. I'm 56kg, 170cm), has better looks than me, is a better student (no problems in school) and is just all-around a better person than me. People follow him around, and as much as it hurts my pride to admit this, I am envious that girls just follow him around.\\n\\nMy family isn't very supportive neither. My aunt and uncle cares for me (I hope) but treats me as if I were some lazy-ass scum, because their son is objectively better than me, even though I am doing my fucking best, trying not to die from a DKA every day. I lost 5-6 pounds in 2 weeks, all muscle mass, because I don't have much body fat. I excercise semi-regularly (45 mins a day, 3-4 hours a wekk, maybe), I study, I do what everyone else does, and I even put more time into it (all possible because I assist school once a month now, all assignemnts are submitted through a school intranet). My grandparents (the ones alive) clearly cares more for my cousins than me, and they don't necessarily hide that. My dad compares me to his former self, and acts like I don't put enough (or any) effort and treats me like a literal pet. People actively avoid me, because my personality is just straight up fucked, and I act so weird, almost pathetic around others, that I'd rather stay at home than humiliate myself in front of others.\\n\\nMy biggest problem and fear is that I'll slowly become my father, because he is the most despicable human being I can think of. He is just such a hypocrite, miserable, self-justifying, rationalizing, condescending piece of shit; but I am so similar to him, whether it be personality, tastes, interests, points of view, etc. Another big fear of mine is that no one will validate my efforts, despite it being my best. But it's already becoming true.\\n\\nI'm just tired of nobody loving me. I had this one girl that I liked since 5 years ago.

My experience telling them wasn't pleasant and I don't know if I'm at fault for sharing or if I'm at fault for expecting a certain behavior.\\n\\nHere's what happened:\\n\\nI am 24, female. I've had depression, anxiety, dissociation and derealisation for over 2 years now, probably had it before but it was only confirmed by a therapist two years ago because that's when I went to see what's wrong with me.\\n\\nNobody knows about this side of me but my ex girlfriend. So recently I told my mom I have anxiety. My family keeps showing at my house randomly to visit and stay for hours and that would cause panic attacks each time because I wan't expecting their visit or planned for it. So one day I burst and told my mom why I'm always upset when they show up like that. (all I expect is a call before hand to prepare myself mentally).\\n\\nI've told them about my dissociation and derealisation because they have been nagging for months wanting me to buy a car and drive instead of commuting and refusing to move to a house that's far from work. (my mom lives with me so me driving is important to take her places) I kept telling them I'm not ready and I just need more practice. (I took so many lessons and wasted over 1500$ learning with no result to the extent I was kicked out of the driving lesson by my instructor because he thought my driving was dangerous) So one day they said I'm a coward and that I should just go and drive and not let my fear control me. So I shared the reason why I can't drive. They first said there's no such thing as what I mentioned and that I shouldn't diagnose myself with no knowledge. I told them I went to 3 therapist and they all confirmed this. After a moment of silence they said I shouldn't let this stop me from driving. I said no It should stop me because it's a danger to my self and the people around me. My sister said ok seek help. I said it could take years to heal some never do beside I can't afford to see therapists at the moment. she sent me a link with affordable therapist to contact.\\n\\nAfter going home my mom spoke to me about what she heard. She asked why I never shared this with anyone before. I said because you're my family and I rather not let you worry about me. She then asked about it and I told hear some symptoms not to scare her so much. (she's a doctor so I picked my words wisely) she then said that I shouldn't have shared this. I asked why? she said your brother in law heard. I said so what? are you ashamed of me now that I saw therapist once. That my mental health is not golden? That in your society I'm considered crazy now? I never got an answer...\\n\\nIt's been couple of days now and nothing happened. Nobody talked to me about it. Nobody asked about it. nobody read about it to know what the hell I experience. it's nothing. Like I never shared anything like they just don't want to think about it or even acknowledge it.\\n\\nIs it my fault for sharing? is it my fault for expecting at least some interest in knowing what I have? they are my family after all and I feel that's the least I should expect. Is it because what I shared aren't considered as important as depression?

She then asked about it and I told hear some symptoms not to scare her so much. (she's a doctor so I picked my words wisely) she then said that I shouldn't have shared this. I asked why? she said your brother in law heard. I said so what? are you ashamed of me now that I saw therapist once. That my mental health is not golden? That in your society I'm considered crazy now? I never got an answer...\\n\\nIt's been couple of days now and nothing happened. Nobody talked to me about it. Nobody asked about it. nobody read about it to know what the hell I experience. it's nothing. Like I never shared anything like they just don't want to think about it or even acknowledge it.\\n\\nIs it my fault for sharing? is it my fault for expecting at least some interest in knowing what I have? they are my family after all and I feel that's the least I should expect. Is it because what I shared aren't considered as important as depression? (I can never share that with them)\\n\\nPlease share your thoughts and experiences or advices for how to handle this.\\n\\nSorry for the long read but I never share anything with anyone and this is a first for me.\", 'label': 'Trouble falling or staying asleep or sleeping too much'}\n",

Need some feedback, please.', 'post_text': 'So I had my first Dr\\'s appointment to address my increasing anxiety and depression yesterday, and found some things a bit...odd. I\\'d like some feedback on a few things (just need to know whether some of the stuff I\\'m about to post is common, or not)\\n\\n1.) A lot of the stuff was \"up to me\" and I was given questions I had no idea how to prepare for or answer. I went into this with a \"I have no idea what the hell is going on in my head, but it\\'s bad, and I need to address it\" mentality. I have no idea why I\\'m depressed or anxious so much, only that I did NOT used to be like this.\\n\\n*-  \"Do you think your Anxiety is caused by your Depression, or your Depression is caused by your Anxiety?\"* \\n\\n*The answer? I honestly have no idea, I\\'m coming in with my own mind being a total mystery to me. I didn\\'t know it had to be either one of these.*\\n\\n*- I was asked what \"kind\" of medication I think I should be on (given a choice between Wellbutrin or another unnamed medication that attacks both Anxiety and Depression together)* \\n\\n*- I had no idea how to answer this either, I don\\'t know. When I made this decision I was only 30 minutes into discussing this with a medical professional for the first time in my life, I have absolutely no clue.* \\n\\n2.) After this short 45-minute single appointment with a Psychiatrist, I walked out with prescriptions for Wellbutrin XL and Vistaril. I haven\\'t taken either yet, because I\\'m not sure that\\'s right for me. I just feel like 45-minutes wasn\\'t even close to enough time for me to \"explain me\" and give enough information that a Doctor could make a decision on the right medication for me. And I **know** that antidepressants and medications of this sort are a total crapshoot, but even given that, I don\\'t feel confident that I\\'d even be taking a **good** crapshoot from a single 45-minute appointment with a brand new doctor.\\n\\n*- Is that notion true? Are antidepressants and medications like this still a total crapshoot? Can\\'t doctors to prior testing to figure out how a particular medication will affect an individual? It just feels odd...coming from a world I\\'d previous known (getting diagnosed and treated for migranes) where everything was \"testing testing testing! MRI and Cat Scans and Blood tests and this and that!!!\" before being able to figure out something that works for migraines. But now with my mental health it\\'s just \"idk, we\\'ll throw this against the wall and see if it sticks.\" Makes me incredibly uncomfortable.* \\n\\n3.) When taking my first steps to address my issues a few weeks ago (and making this appointment with a psychiatrist), I had **absolutely no idea** what kind of doctor I\\'m supposed to see, what is recommended, or who even \"diagnoses you\" with depression or anxiety. I don\\'t want to self-diagnose, it just doesn\\'t feel right. (After this appointment I still didn\\'t feel like I was \"formally diagnosed\", just given medication).\\n\\n*So I chose this Psychiatrists office because they had decent reviews of any I could find. I made an appointment before I understood that the \"Psychiatrist\" is the one that mainly focuses on drugs and medication, NOT therapy.*\\n\\n*- Does \"formal diagnosis\" happen? What kind of doctor does that? Or is that a totally false preconceived notion I have.*\\n\\n*- What kind of doctor is it most common to see first? A psychologist, CBT, psychiatrist, therapist? I just don\\'t know all the terminology.* \\n\\nThe path I\\'ve currently chosen: I\\'ve not taken my medication (not started), cancelled appointments with this psychiatrist, and gotten an appointment for CBT with a therapist first, which feels like a \"safer\" path for me.  As much as I want to address my issues NOW (I\\'m impatient), going straight to medication just didn\\'t feel right...\\n\\nI could go on a rant about just how difficult it has been for someone with no prior experience trying to deal with this new situation in American Healthcare, but I won\\'t.

Due to depression and lack of budget for healthier foods (i work part time for 7.75 an hour) I've gained more weight than I'm comfortable with. I would like to balance out my poor eating habits (since I'm living off of the cheapest things i can afford- ramen, chef boyardee, you get the picture) with more physical fitness. I have a few medical problems that prevent me from being as active as I'd like. A few years ago i had an accident and broke my spine so i have hardware implanted and a bum hip. Even taking a six hour shift at work leaves me all but unable to walk the next day. I've started taking walks, and since i live in a rough part of an inner city its difficult to be by myself and not have someone harrass me or follow me. I can't afford a gym membership so i was wondering if anyone had tips or suggestions on how i can do more from my home. If it matters I'd like to focus on my stomach and love handles, its just hard because of my back and hip problems to do a bunch of situps and pushups and leg lifts. Does anyone know how to do these to reduce my pain so i can keep going longer for better results? My body image issues are really starting to affect me, and they havent before... I will be crossposting as well in a health advice subreddit. Any suggestions and tips are welcome. TIA!\",\n",

From that time, he's started failing classes and has begun heavy marijuana/alcohol use (even being hospitalized for the latter once). For what it's worth, he routinely started talking about how his anxiety started getting better because he didn't care about school anymore and because he started smoking. My parents are doing all that they can and know how to do to help him out. I just got back from college on spring break, and they broke the news to me about why my brother wasn't here when I got back—he had just flown out to Pacific Quest (PQ) this morning.

My mom showed me a video, and it seemed suspiciously sugarcoated/idealistic, so I went on a reddit search to find out more. God damn. I thought it was just one post bashing PQ, but it seems that there's nearly nothing positive to say about it, other than the fact that it, relative to other similar programs, has a better quality of life (and that seems like it's not saying a lot at all). What do I do in terms of my parents, brother, and PQ? I really am terrified for my brother's well being—from reading, it seems that PQ is nothing but regressive for health. Should he stay?

She went there twice and she's now convinced that she has depression, I didn't say anything because I don't want to invalidate her feeling but honestly I don't think so (but again, i'm not the one who should say it). First of all, she told me the counselor didn't mention it, but made her understand it in a subtle way. Also, she doesn't exhibit any signs of depression, she doesn't have a lack of interest in doing things, or a change in appetite. I feel very bad writing this, I know every depression is different, but she has no problems going through the day, and it's always the one to ask to hang out for example, while I couldn't (and sometimes still can't) get out of bed in the morning, let alone function properly.\\n\\nAll of this makes me feel extremely uncomfortable, every time she talks about it with idk what to say because I can't really empathize with her. She also mentions it a lot, which makes me even more uncomfortable, like the other time she was like \"oh, we are both depressed, what a great couple!\" and I was like wtf, first of all I'm not depressed, and then I know it may be a way to cope with it but it sounded really bad.\",\n",

But now I want to post something. I actually have typed this post out several times this week but always ended up deleting it. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. I’m gonna start with what happened today. This story has nothing bad happening but it caused me mental pain. I’m typing this out because the four hours I spent with my fiancé has been the longest I have felt happy this week and I just need to talk to anyone right now. \\n\\nMe and my fiancé went to the gym this morning. He had to pick me up due to we both still with our parents and haven’t told anyone about our engagement( we want to surprise them and are waiting to by financial set). We went to the gym worked out for an hour or two then we went out to do some errands. I was bringing my resume to places applied to and my fiancé was my ride. After that he got on the freeway and we were just driving and making jokes. I was telling him a funny story about a quest I did in a game I’m playing. Then I got a phone call from my mom. She wanted to know where I was and when I’m going to be back. Now I know this is seems like a red flag but she only asked because she had to get a new work uniform and my other siblings were going with her and no will be home. That doesn’t seem bad but my mom’s stepdad lives with us and he is unable to much he can walk and stuff but has a hard time remembering things. So someone has to be home with him.  \\n\\nI said ok and we started to head back. This when I noticed that my fiancé was upset. I asked what’s wrong, it turns out that he had a surprise for me. He was taking to a sushi place that he promised to take a while back. He also had plans for the whole day for us but wanted to surprise me with it. I started feeling like I ruined the whole day. His plans and the way he described it made it sound like today was gonna be the most perfect date/day. On the way back I was just upset and angry with myself and my siblings. I was upset with my siblings because they are all young adult, hell two of them are adults,(21 and 19) but one of couldn’t stay home for a couple of minute until the rest of my family got home. \\n\\nWhile we got to my house he didn’t even park, he just stop in first we said goodbye and I went inside. I say that because he always parks in the driveway, gets out, and walks me to my front door. He did try calm me down before hand but I was just so angry. My parents were still home and asked me what’s wrong and why was I upset. I told them but my mom made feel worse. She made me feel like I should have told her and that it was my fault for not knowing about his surprise for me. My dad tried to tell her that she was wrong and that how was I supposed to know about my fiancé’s surprise. \\n\\nI was texting and later was in call with my fiancé while that was happening and he was still upset but was telling me that it was not fault. That what happened was unfortunate and upsetting but it wasn’t my fault. Every-time I tried to blame myself he would tell me to stop. That yes he was upset and he was sorry for upsetting me. It ended with me and him in a phone trying to make the other person feel better but it didn’t work. Now he has gone to bed and I’m still awake still upset my eyes burn a little due to crying. \\n\\nI just want to talk, just to clear my mind of bad thoughts. I can’t call him because he has work in the morning and I want him to rest. I feel like I need help, I’m a mess. I feel like crap my mental state is fucked due feel like my happiness was ripped from me. I just want to start the with a smile and end the day with a smile.\",\n",

But now I want to post something. I actually have typed this post out several times this week but always ended up deleting it. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. I’m gonna start with what happened today. This story has nothing bad happening but it caused me mental pain. I’m typing this out because the four hours I spent with my fiancé has been the longest I have felt happy this week and I just need to talk to anyone right now. \\n\\nMe and my fiancé went to the gym this morning. He had to pick me up due to we both still with our parents and haven’t told anyone about our engagement( we want to surprise them and are waiting to by financial set). We went to the gym worked out for an hour or two then we went out to do some errands. I was bringing my resume to places applied to and my fiancé was my ride. After that he got on the freeway and we were just driving and making jokes. I was telling him a funny story about a quest I did in a game I’m playing. Then I got a phone call from my mom. She wanted to know where I was and when I’m going to be back. Now I know this is seems like a red flag but she only asked because she had to get a new work uniform and my other siblings were going with her and no will be home. That doesn’t seem bad but my mom’s stepdad lives with us and he is unable to much he can walk and stuff but has a hard time remembering things. So someone has to be home with him.  \\n\\nI said ok and we started to head back. This when I noticed that my fiancé was upset. I asked what’s wrong, it turns out that he had a surprise for me. He was taking to a sushi place that he promised to take a while back. He also had plans for the whole day for us but wanted to surprise me with it. I started feeling like I ruined the whole day. His plans and the way he described it made it sound like today was gonna be the most perfect date/day. On the way back I was just upset and angry with myself and my siblings. I was upset with my siblings because they are all young adult, hell two of them are adults,(21 and 19) but one of couldn’t stay home for a couple of minute until the rest of my family got home. \\n\\nWhile we got to my house he didn’t even park, he just stop in first we said goodbye and I went inside. I say that because he always parks in the driveway, gets out, and walks me to my front door. He did try calm me down before hand but I was just so angry. My parents were still home and asked me what’s wrong and why was I upset. I told them but my mom made feel worse. She made me feel like I should have told her and that it was my fault for not knowing about his surprise for me. My dad tried to tell her that she was wrong and that how was I supposed to know about my fiancé’s surprise. \\n\\nI was texting and later was in call with my fiancé while that was happening and he was still upset but was telling me that it was not fault. That what happened was unfortunate and upsetting but it wasn’t my fault. Every-time I tried to blame myself he would tell me to stop. That yes he was upset and he was sorry for upsetting me. It ended with me and him in a phone trying to make the other person feel better but it didn’t work. Now he has gone to bed and I’m still awake still upset my eyes burn a little due to crying. \\n\\nI just want to talk, just to clear my mind of bad thoughts. I can’t call him because he has work in the morning and I want him to rest. I feel like I need help, I’m a mess. I feel like crap my mental state is fucked due feel like my happiness was ripped from me. I just want to start the with a smile and end the day with a smile.\",\n",

Even new people at work make friends with each other, but I feel like they all think I’m just weird or perhaps a bitch simply because I’m so awkward and probably say the wrong thing all the time, or maybe I just don’t say anything when I should. I’m so clumsy too. Like REALLY clumsy. Constantly spilling things, hurting myself, fumbling especially when I know I’m being watched. I don’t know who I am.

(i'm quiet, boring, and sad.) people i catch feelings for either reject me outright or just stop talking to me. someone i've known for 8 years (and dated 4 times) suddenly cut contact with me after not talking for months. the person i've been saying 'i love you' to for the past 1.5 years doesn't even want to be in an actual relationship to me. it all just feels like sweet but empty words.\\n* one mom is on disability, and my older brother doesn't have a job--he just picks up \\\"gigs\\\" maybe once a month. my other mom just quit her job on the spot two days ago, and has just been sitting around watching TV. i'm the only one in the house with a stable job. so, i can't quit.\\n* my health has never been the best, and i'm honestly just waiting to see when it finally tanks. part of me hopes it's terminal.\\n* i can't even afford a therapist that i desperately (obviously) need. i know i can talk to my friends, but i don't want to burden them when they already have a lot on their plates. no one wants to talk to somebody that's always bringing up negative or heavy topics. i don't want them to leave me too.\\n* not even online friends talk to me very much. i'm just kind of Here.\\n* i'm pretty convinced that the only romantic, lasting relationship i'll ever have is with imaginary characters in a dating sim game. now i can barely play anything with a romance plot because i'll just make myself sad.\\n\\ni almost went through with it on christmas eve.the only reason i didn't was to keep from ruining christmas for my family.sometimes i wish i did it anyway.\\n\\ntl;dr i feel trapped and alone in everything, and i feel like it's drowning me, and i want to let it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nedit:  i tried posting this a day ago, but it didn't even show up on the feed lmao.  just my luck!```,\n",

My name is Nick and i want to share my story.. i live in a small town in Greece, im 17 years old i live with my mother and i am morbidly obese 150kg 1.72 height (my max weight was 196). 2 years ago i lost my father from obesity he had many difficulties in the last years of his life with obesity, diabetes, Cushing's syndrome, hormonal issues and more.. i had to watch him suffer for a good chunk of my life so did my mother and my 2 older brothers, after losing him my mother lost it she doesn't think properly anymore and that leads to many bad decisions more smoking, pills, gambling and she doesn't take care of her self.. she eats rarely even tho i try to convince her to eat she refuses. My whole life i was overweight and didn't really have that many friends and most of them only wanted to take advantage of me because of money or something else and that lead to many trust issues low self-esteem and loneliness.. growing up i never had anyone to talk to because my brothers did not really care back then and my parents were very busy working.. they tried to replace love and care with money and gifts so i spent a lot of time by myself in our home not going outside but it didn't bother me back then because it felt normal that way and soon i started to have an interest to the internet and computers in general (video games youtube hardware etc etc) and thats where the whole started going downhill.. i didn't have space for a computer back then because i shared my room with my brothers so i started going to internet cafes near me and i would spend all of my money to buy more playtime and prepaid cards for games.. every day i was getting more and more addicted to the internet and that lead to less time outside, less physical activity, more and more weight gain and i started skipping school. My social skills were and still are very poor so talking to people thru social media made it easier for me to communicate with others and make some friends so thats what i did and because of that i found some amazing people that i had lots of fun with and kept me distracted from my real life problems. Some of them were momentary but some i still talk to even till this day. My whole life i had to endure family drama from both sides of the family and i had to solve every single problem i had by myself cause i did not want to bring up more problems to my family so i had to mature pretty early on in my life.\\n\\nFast forward to now i have lost 2 school years because of absences i dont have any REAL friends that i can count on and no one to talk to i spend my whole day in my room with nothing to do, i dont even sit on my computer anymore i just lie on my bed sleeping or thinking,crying. I am working on losing my weight and thankfully that goes pretty well but i still feel like shit and i find no motivation to keep trying or even living. I am very self conscious about my weight and i hate the way i look regardless of the weight, oftentimes i hate myself and i am disgusted/disappointed with what I've become.. every day that passes these feelings get stronger and stronger i don't know what to do.\\n\\nNow that you know a little bit about me i want to ask for advice because i have no idea what to do or where to start on fixing things..\\nI feel like i lost interest in everything and i feel like I don't want to live anymore..i feel alone, lost and that no one likes/loves me for who i am and those who do do it out of pity or just do it because i am a family member, i dont have anyone close to me that i can talk to because the only close real friend i had started avoiding me and i don't really blame him for that. I am ready to make a change because i want strength to be able to support the people i love and if i don't make a change i fear that even more negative thoughts will get in my head like self harm or worse.

My name is Nick and i want to share my story.. i live in a small town in Greece, im 17 years old i live with my mother and i am morbidly obese 150kg 1.72 height (my max weight was 196). 2 years ago i lost my father from obesity he had many difficulties in the last years of his life with obesity, diabetes, Cushing's syndrome, hormonal issues and more.. i had to watch him suffer for a good chunk of my life so did my mother and my 2 older brothers, after losing him my mother lost it she doesn't think properly anymore and that leads to many bad decisions more smoking, pills, gambling and she doesn't take care of her self.. she eats rarely even tho i try to convince her to eat she refuses. My whole life i was overweight and didn't really have that many friends and most of them only wanted to take advantage of me because of money or something else and that lead to many trust issues low self-esteem and loneliness.. growing up i never had anyone to talk to because my brothers did not really care back then and my parents were very busy working.. they tried to replace love and care with money and gifts so i spent a lot of time by myself in our home not going outside but it didn't bother me back then because it felt normal that way and soon i started to have an interest to the internet and computers in general (video games youtube hardware etc etc) and thats where the whole started going downhill.. i didn't have space for a computer back then because i shared my room with my brothers so i started going to internet cafes near me and i would spend all of my money to buy more playtime and prepaid cards for games.. every day i was getting more and more addicted to the internet and that lead to less time outside, less physical activity, more and more weight gain and i started skipping school. My social skills were and still are very poor so talking to people thru social media made it easier for me to communicate with others and make some friends so thats what i did and because of that i found some amazing people that i had lots of fun with and kept me distracted from my real life problems. Some of them were momentary but some i still talk to even till this day. My whole life i had to endure family drama from both sides of the family and i had to solve every single problem i had by myself cause i did not want to bring up more problems to my family so i had to mature pretty early on in my life. Fast forward to now i have lost 2 school years because of absences i dont have any REAL friends that i can count on and no one to talk to i spend my whole day in my room with nothing to do, i dont even sit on my computer anymore i just lie on my bed sleeping or thinking,crying. I am working on losing my weight and thankfully that goes pretty well but i still feel like shit and i find no motivation to keep trying or even living. I am very self conscious about my weight and i hate the way i look regardless of the weight, oftentimes i hate myself and i am disgusted/disappointed with what I've become.. every day that passes these feelings get stronger and stronger i don't know what to do. Now that you know a little bit about me i want to ask for advice because i have no idea what to do or where to start on fixing things.. I feel like i lost interest in everything and i feel like I don't want to live anymore..i feel alone, lost and that no one likes/loves me for who i am and those who do do it out of pity or just do it because i am a family member, i dont have anyone close to me that i can talk to because the only close real friend i had started avoiding me and i don't really blame him for that. I am ready to make a change because i want strength to be able to support the people i love and if i don't make a change i fear that even more negative thoughts will get in my head like self harm or worse. I know i can't make it by myself and that's why im asking for your help any advice would be helpful and VERY appreciated.\",\n",

And then it hit me - repressed childhood trauma, unhealthy relationships with my family members and too many disappointments in my love life gave me depression.\\n\\nAt first I thought it\\'s only a bad phase and I was expecting it to end soon since I was about to start my summer vacations.

That\\'s when I realized that \"bad phase\" was a special one, but I only decided to get specialized help when I was already 4 months deep into it. At that point I was a mess, crying several times every day, spending all my free time sleeping, being terrified of my own thoughts, started thinking about suicide, pursuing a toxic online relationship, being unable to watch movies or reading books due to losing my ability to concentrate. At that moment, one of my best friends told me I was only a shadow of the person I used to be. The best feeling I was able to get about anything was \"this is almost acceptable\".\\n\\nAfter my first visit to the psychiatrist I was put on medication and after only one month things became a little bit brighter for me - Christmas was coming and I started WANTING TO DO STUFF AWAKE!! I started watching netflix again, playing video games, hanging out with friends. I was still sad mostly, but I was able to enjoy these things from time to time which was nice. I also got fired right before Christmas for sleeping too much at work and doing almost nothing because of my depression, but I wasn\\'t even mad about it.

The past two summers I will have a really good day/week/ whatever and then one morning I’ll wake up and feel “hungover” or “in a fog” even though I haven’t done anything to bring this on (like drinking, using substances). Also, I’m quite active physically - so that’s also strange.\\n\\nWhat’s even more frustrating are the physical symptoms- my legs feel like noodles and I feel like I cannot “wake up” despite caffeine and Adderall.\\n\\nTwo summers ago it hit me at a physical therapy appointment- literally felt so incredibly off that I had to sit down for a minute. The PT said “maybe it was “menopause”. Wanted to throttle him, lol.\\n\\nIn a span of 24 hours I went from a normal mood to really off. It progressed to the point where I spent most of August in bed - only getting up to use the washroom and do basic things. I vividly recall literally crawling to clean the cat box my body felt so heavy. I actually felt paralyzed. I also recall having to return and item I borrowed from a friend and having to drive and being so out of it I wasn’t sure I could. It felt as if I was wading through deep water or mud.\\n\\nLast summer I wasn’t expecting it Bc I thought the summer before was “just a fluke” or “hormones” but I vividly recall the day before I was very productive- did a lot around the house and generally felt “up”.  The next day when I got out of bed, my legs were like noodles going down the stairs and I felt “off”.\\nI was sitting drinking coffee when my husband looked at me and asked if I was ok.

If so, could use some advice', 'post_text': 'For the past two summers like clock work around the last week in July I have been hit with the above - I don’t know what else it is other than reverse SAD. It usually starts with a general few months of feeling good and stable - meaning I’m feeling normal, motivated and generally happy with some dips that I’m used to for the most part. The past two summers I will have a really good day/week/ whatever and then one morning I’ll wake up and feel “hungover” or “in a fog” even though I haven’t done anything to bring this on (like drinking, using substances). Also, I’m quite active physically - so that’s also strange.\\n\\nWhat’s even more frustrating are the physical symptoms- my legs feel like noodles and I feel like I cannot “wake up” despite caffeine and Adderall.\\n\\nTwo summers ago it hit me at a physical therapy appointment- literally felt so incredibly off that I had to sit down for a minute. The PT said “maybe it was “menopause”. Wanted to throttle him, lol.\\n\\nIn a span of 24 hours I went from a normal mood to really off. It progressed to the point where I spent most of August in bed - only getting up to use the washroom and do basic things. I vividly recall literally crawling to clean the cat box my body felt so heavy. I actually felt paralyzed. I also recall having to return and item I borrowed from a friend and having to drive and being so out of it I wasn’t sure I could. It felt as if I was wading through deep water or mud.\\n\\nLast summer I wasn’t expecting it Bc I thought the summer before was “just a fluke” or “hormones” but I vividly recall the day before I was very productive- did a lot around the house and generally felt “up”.  The next day when I got out of bed, my legs were like noodles going down the stairs and I felt “off”.\\nI was sitting drinking coffee when my husband looked at me and asked if I was ok. I thought I was just tired, but as the days progressed I got worse and worse. It took me months to recover Bc I couldn’t find any type of add on medication that I could tolerate that helped.\\n\\nDuring these spells I literally feel as if I’m drugged - I am searching for words, I have no energy.

So, I've been struggling with very severe depression, and even suicidal thoughts. I've been in touch with a mentor, and I suggested going to FL (I live in Virginia, and I have family in Florida) and she thought that would be a good idea, you know, get away from everything for a few days. So, I booked the trip and invited my best friend (who will remain nameless) to go with me. He quickly agreed (especially since he's been on suicide watch for me for over 3 months) and we got out tickets and all was dandy. Today, day 2 of said trip, I've completely lost my friend to the Fortnite video game. I've tried to do stuff with him, he politely declines. I've tried to talk to him, but as soon as I get sick (unfortunately, my main stress coping mechanism is vomiting, completely involuntary. I don't force it) he goes ba k to the game and when I need him the most when I've hit my lowest point (moments ago) he leaves. LEAVES!! I'm at the end of my rope and I don't know what to do. I feel completely alone. Even my family (all except my dad) have used me out completely and taken to my friend instead. I don't know what to do, I've never felt so alone while I'm surrounded by 8 of my closest family members and my best friend. Please help me. I don't know how else to end this. Please help me.\",\n",

My dad is working, my mom is pretty quiet, they both go to sleep before 9pm, and my house is pretty far away from the city (no buses, and I don't drive) so nowhere I can go. I'll be here for a month and a half, and I think the silence and lonely feeling will drive me crazy.

            "  \"post_text\": \"I need help.\\n\\n17 year old male, 18 beginning of July. \\n\\nI've been struggling with my mental health for all of my life, and it got worse after starting puberty. \\n\\nI've always been terrible with social groups and interactions. Never managed to make a lot of friends, and those I did never sticked. Had some of your regular trauma from parents and older brother. \\n\\nI've always felt alone.\\n\\nWhen I became a teenager I started with the depression. Got very bad episodes, where I would shut down, and fake illness so I could stay home. I missed one month of school once, and on a trip to Italy for school I faked illness for two weeks so I could stay in bed, and could only think about jumping off a bridge.\\n\\nAs I got deeper into adolescence not only did my mental health deteriorate, but my ability too. My memory became poor, and my focus was gone, always having mental fog. I couldn't remember words, and speak eloquently. Math ability went to the shitter, always making stupid mistakes that would then seem retarded later. \\n\\nMy IQ seemed to have dropped as much as 10 points, since I have periodically been applied tests and only perform worse. \\n\\nStarting high school made me much more suicidal because of this, and the isolation of not knowing anyone, and the people I did know wouldn't even look me in the eyes. \\n\\nI had already gone to a psychologist, and after that a neurologist, and recently a therapist.\\n\\nGot medication, and have been on it since 2017. The doctor has changed my meds more times than I can count, and none of them have helped. She told me that I would probably never be off of meds, but they still don't help me. I have no cure.\\n\\nI feel I have been slowly getting worse, going down my own dark little hole. \\n\\nI've always been obsessive, but now it feels like it's all I am. I feel like I'm losing my mind. Everything makes me irritated, or break down. Noise seemed to be the problem. Voices make me go mad, but even when I'm alone and in silence I keep thinking about everything needing to shut up. The chatter is all inside my head, and it never stops. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI feel like sometimes I am already dead on the inside, and I'm not really human. Just a shell o what I wanted to be. \\n\\nI started going out to party's and things, mostly just filling myself with alcohol, or I'll just drive around going as fast as I can. Hoping I'll be something else, hoping I'll feel.\\n\\nI've had one relationship with a girl, that eventually ended. I loved her but after that I couldn't feel anything for anyone (and no, not even her). I just ended up obsessing over her, even if I didn't feel a thing. Really tried after I started to get over her, and even tried with another girl, but even with all that I managed to bosses with her as well, and got called a creep and that I harassed her. The meds make me worse off. My sex drive is completely dead. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBy the end of high school I have made some friends, but I end up isolating myself, and losing them.\\n\\nI'm starting college in August, and I'll move to another city for that, but I fear that will only isolate me, and make me worse. I think that if I don't kill myself soon, I'll do it then. I see no real future past a certain point. \\n\\nI fear it'll all colapse, and I'll truly break down.

I don't see any future anymore, just think I'll kill myself one of these days.\", 'post_text': \"I need help.\\n\\n17 year old male, 18 beginning of July. \\n\\nI've been struggling with my mental health for all of my life, and it got worse after starting puberty. \\n\\nI've always been terrible with social groups and interactions. Never managed to make a lot of friends, and those I did never sticked. Had some of your regular trauma from parents and older brother. \\n\\nI've always felt alone.\\n\\nWhen I became a teenager I started with the depression. Got very bad episodes, where I would shut down, and fake illness so I could stay home. I missed one month of school once, and on a trip to Italy for school I faked illness for two weeks so I could stay in bed, and could only think about jumping off a bridge.\\n\\nAs I got deeper into adolescence not only did my mental health deteriorate, but my ability too. My memory became poor, and my focus was gone, always having mental fog. I couldn't remember words, and speak eloquently. Math ability went to the shitter, always making stupid mistakes that would then seem retarded later. \\n\\nMy IQ seemed to have dropped as much as 10 points, since I have periodically been applied tests and only perform worse. \\n\\nStarting high school made me much more suicidal because of this, and the isolation of not knowing anyone, and the people I did know wouldn't even look me in the eyes. \\n\\nI had already gone to a psychologist, and after that a neurologist, and recently a therapist.\\n\\nGot medication, and have been on it since 2017. The doctor has changed my meds more times than I can count, and none of them have helped. She told me that I would probably never be off of meds, but they still don't help me. I have no cure.\\n\\nI feel I have been slowly getting worse, going down my own dark little hole. \\n\\nI've always been obsessive, but now it feels like it's all I am. I feel like I'm losing my mind. Everything makes me irritated, or break down. Noise seemed to be the problem. Voices make me go mad, but even when I'm alone and in silence I keep thinking about everything needing to shut up. The chatter is all inside my head, and it never stops. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI feel like sometimes I am already dead on the inside, and I'm not really human. Just a shell o what I wanted to be. \\n\\nI started going out to party's and things, mostly just filling myself with alcohol, or I'll just drive around going as fast as I can. Hoping I'll be something else, hoping I'll feel.\\n\\nI've had one relationship with a girl, that eventually ended. I loved her but after that I couldn't feel anything for anyone (and no, not even her). I just ended up obsessing over her, even if I didn't feel a thing. Really tried after I started to get over her, and even tried with another girl, but even with all that I managed to bosses with her as well, and got called a creep and that I harassed her. The meds make me worse off. My sex drive is completely dead. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBy the end of high school I have made some friends, but I end up isolating myself, and losing them.\\n\\nI'm starting college in August, and I'll move to another city for that, but I fear that will only isolate me, and make me worse. I think that if I don't kill myself soon, I'll do it then. I see no real future past a certain point. \\n\\nI fear it'll all colapse, and I'll truly break down. I fear I'll lose interest in my career, since it has already happened. I was going to study astrophysics, but after an episode I saw nothing in that. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI'm going crazy, always suffering. Everyday is pain, and I just want it to end. I am sick. \\n\\nI contemplate suicide everyday, but what ultimately stops me is just the possibility of a failed attempt, and getting scarred for many years to come, and always under watchful eyes after the attempt. \\n\\nThe hurdle of death is my prison.\", 'label': 'Trouble concentrating on things such as reading the newspaper or watching television.'}\n",
